Warning! The task below looks complicated ;) 
<hr>
Write the code to `prompt` for a login.

If the input is <b>"Monty" or "Chip"</b>, then `prompt` for a password, for any other input `alert` "Wrong login". If the user presses CANCEL (or Escape), do nothing.

If the password is <b>"Cheese" for Monty and "Gadget" for Chip</b>, then output "Access granted", otherwise output "Wrong password".
