# Setup your environment 

To start developing in JavaScript, a good working place is required.

This section contains instructions to setup the programs you may need.

## Code editor   

First we need a code editor.

There are many around, but the one you choose should support:
<ol>
<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Autocomplete</li>
</ol>

If you are using a code editor already, then make sure it supports JavaScript. Some editors may require additional plugin.

If you haven't made up your mind about an editor yet, check out the following ones.

<b>The following IDEs are commercial, but quite good at JS.</b>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">Intellij WebStorm</a> and related PHPStorm for PHP, IDEA for Java</li>
<li>MS Visual Studio (latest) is good at JS</li>
<li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide">Komodo IDE</a></li>
</ul>

<b>Noncommercial IDE:</b>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and other IDEs on this platform: <a href="http://aptana.com">Aptana</a>, <a href="http://spket.com/">Spket IDE</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a></li>
</ul>

There are many great IDE beyound the list, of course.

<b>Lightweight editors</b>

A lightweight editor may not be as powerful as an IDE, but it is fast and easy.

<ul>
<li>TextMate (Mac, non-free)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scintilla.org/">SciTe</a> is simple, lightweight and very fast (Windows, free).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit">Komodo Edit</a> (Cross-platform, free).</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/">Notepad++</a> (Windows, free).</li>
</ul>

And, agains, surely there are much more editors around.

Note, "vi" and "emacs" are not listed. That's because their adepts already know they're cool, but starting with them is kind-of hard. Still you can try.

Choose anything. Just make sure that it is not Notepad.


## Browsers   

All supported browsers should be installed. Current trend is that browsers tend to support standards and implementations converge, although there are differences.

<b>You need at least:</b> Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. 

Grab them here:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://getfirefox.com">http://getfirefox.com (Firefox)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">http://www.google.com/chrome (Chrome)</a></li>
</ul>

Usually you also need Safari, Opera and few other IE versions.

If you work under Linux or MacOS, then a virtual machine is required for Windows IE.



## Summary   

Most developers first create scripts in Firefox. If everything works, the script is tested in Chrome and IE, and then in other major browsers.

It also makes sence to have different versions of IE installed in virtual machines.
