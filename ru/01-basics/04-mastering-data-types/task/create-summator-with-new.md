# Create a summator with new 

Create an <i>constructor function</i> `Summator` which creates an object with two methods: 
<ul>
<li>`sum(a,b)` returns a sum of two values</li>
<li>`run()` prompts the visitor for two values and outputs their sum.</li>
</ul>

`new Summator().run()` should prompt for two values and alert their sum.
