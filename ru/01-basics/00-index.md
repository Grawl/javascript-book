# JavaScript: from the Ground to Closures 

The aim of this tutorial is to grasp the JavaScript required to build interfaces and really understand what's going on.

This includes semi-advanced topics like closures, but misses easy topics like "Working with Date and Time", because they are not strictly required. So we can get to DOM prepared and fast enough.
