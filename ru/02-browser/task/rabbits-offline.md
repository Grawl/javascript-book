Make the "rabbits" example with external script work on your PC. 

<ul>
<li>Open the file online: <a href="/files/tutorial/browser/script/rabbits_ext.html">rabbits_ext.html</a>.</li>
<li>Put both HTML and JS on your hard drive and make sure it opens and button works.</li>
</ul>

Note. If you are opening html from your <i>filesystem</i>, not from a site, then "/my/script.js" will be an <i>absolute path</i>, from filesystem root. 

You also can use <i>relative paths</i> like "script.js" for files in same folder with HTML, or "my/script.js" for the file in subfolder.

You can download the archived solution here: <a href="/files/tutorial/browser/script/rabbits_offline.zip">rabbits_offline.zip</a>. Just unpack it and open rabbits.html in your browser.

Note, the relative path is used for the script.
